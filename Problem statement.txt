Problems/Challenges faced in the Project are as follows

1)Dataset Issues – Large storage requirements, dataset bias, limited realistic deepfakes, and class imbalance affect training.
2)Frame Extraction – Extracting frames from high-resolution videos is computationally expensive and slow.
3)Face Detection – Detecting and cropping faces in every frame increases processing time.
4)Slow Frame Extraction – Processing each frame from videos adds overhead.
5)Real-time Detection Challenges – Inference delay makes deepfake detection slow in live scenarios.
6)Time Complexity - Dataset Processing, Frame extraction, Face detection, Preprocessing, Model training, and Real-time inference.
